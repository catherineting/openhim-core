Basic configuration
===================

This getting started guide will take you through two very important parts of the OpenHIM console which will allow you to create **Clients** and **Channels** to get messages routed through the system.

Before you get started with **Clients** and **Channels** you will need OpenHIM core and OpenHIM console setup. To do so, follow the installation guide [here](/getting-started.html).

To get a better understanding of what the openHIM core does and how it works, read up on the [OpenHIM core concepts](/about.html)

A **Client** is usually some system that you want to able to send request to the OpenHIM. Setting up a **client** allows the OpenHIM to authenticate requests. A **Channel** defines a path that a request will take through the OpenHIM. It describes one more **routes** for the request to be forwarded to, which **clients** are allowed to use this **channel**, which requests are to be direccted to this **channel** and many more options that allow you to controls what happens for a particular request.

To manage **clients** and **channels** you will need to log into the OpenHIM console and then you may follow the steps below.

**Note** - Only an Admin user has the permission to Add/Edit/Delete a **Client** or **Channel**

Adding Clients
--------------

Follow the below steps to successfully create/update a **Client**

* Navigate to the **Clients** menu option found in the left sidebar.
* On the **Clients** page you will be presented with a list of all the created **Clients**
* Click on the blue "**+ Client**" button to open a popup modal box where you will supply the **Client** details **OR** click on one of the existing **Clients** to open up the popup modal with the **Clients'** saved details.
* Supply all the required fields (marked with a *) and click the blue "**Save changes**" button when completed.

There are many fields that you may supply, here is an explanation of what each of them do:

* **Client ID** - This is a unique ID giving to a client to be used as a reference when adding **Channels** as well as for authorisation checking.
* **Client Name** - This is a descriptive name of the **Client**.
* **Domain** - A domain that is associated with this **Client** - **Note** The domain needs to match the CN of the certificate if a certificate is used otherwise the **Client** won't be authorised successfully.
* **Roles** - The **Client** roles field is a list of authorized user groups that are allowed to access this channel. You can either select a role from the suggested roles that appear when you start typing, or you can add a new role to the list by typing in the role and pressing "**Enter**"
* **Certificate** - The certificate field is used when the OpenHIM core is running using Mutual TLS Authentication and needs to authenticate requests coming from the **Client**. By default, OpenHIM core uses Mutual TLS Authentication
* **Basic Auth Password** - The password field is used when the OpenHIM core is running in basic auth mode and does not require a certificate, it does however require a password.

**Note** - Either a Certificate OR a Basic Auth Password is required depending on the configuration. If Basic Auth is enabled in the OpenHIM core configuration then only a password is required, if Mutual TLS Authentication is enabled then a **Client** Certificate is required.

**Note** - When a **Client** Certificate is added or updated, the OpenHIM console will inform the user that a server restart is required. This is for the new certificate to be applied correctly. The user can either decide to manually restart the server at a later time or to click the red "**Restart Server Now!**" button.

Adding Channels
---------------

Follow the below steps to successfully create/update a **Channel**

* Navigate to the **Channels** menu option found in the left sidebar.
* On the **Channels** page you will be presented with a list of all the created **Channels**
* Click on the blue "**+ Channel**" button to open a popup modal box where you will supply the **Channel** details **OR** click on one of the existing **Channels** to open up the popup modal with the **Channels'** saved details.
* Supply all the required fields and click the blue "**Save changes**" button when completed.

The two _most_ important fields to supply are the **URL Pattern** field and the **Allowed roles and clients** field. The **URL Pattern** field describes which incoming requests should be send down this **channel**. It does this by looking at the URL of the incoming request and testing if it matches the RegEx that you supply in this field. Note, only the first matched **channel** that is found recieves the request for processing. The **Allowed roles and clients** field identifies which **clients** are allowed to send requests to this **channel**. If a request matches a **channel** but the **client** system is not specified in this field or a **role** containing that the **client** belongs to is not specified in this field then the request will be denied access to the **channel**.

There are many fields that you may supply and these are spread over a number of tabs, here is an explanation of what each of them do:

* **Basic Info tab**
    * **Channel Name** - This is a descriptive name of the **Channel**.
    * **URL Pattern** - Supply a URL pattern to match an incoming transaction - **Note** this field excepts a RegEx value - More information on RegEx can be found [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Regular_Expressions) or [here](http://www.regular-expressions.info/)
    * **Priority** - If a transaction matches the URL patterns of two or more channels, then the channel with higher priority will be picked. A value of 1 is the highest possible priority (first priority). Larger numbers therefore indicate that a channel should take lower priority.
    * **Channel Type** - Select a **Channel** type
        * **HTTP** - Default **Channel** type.
        * **TCP** - Supply a TCP Host and Port
        * **TLS** - Supply a TLS Host and Port
        * **Polling** - Supply a Polling schedule - Cron format: '*/10 * * * *' or Written format: '10 minutes' - The module 'Agenda' is used to accomplish the polling - You can find more documentation [here](https://github.com/rschmukler/agenda)
* **Access Control tab**:
    * **Allowed roles and clients** - Supply the roles and **Clients** allowed to make requests to this channel
