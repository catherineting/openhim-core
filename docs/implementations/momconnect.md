MomConnect
===============

MomConnect is a National Department of Health (NDoH) initiative to use cellphone SMS technology to register every pregnant woman in South Africa.

Once enrolled the system will send each mother stage-based messages to support her and her baby during the course of her pregnancy, childbirth and up to the childâ€™s first birthday.

The system will also be used to provide feedback (rating, compliments and complaints) about public health services to a central communication centre.

MomConnect aims to strengthen demand and accountability of Maternal and Child Health services in order to improve access, coverage and quality of care for mothers and their children in the community.
